# Create a Python function that accepts a string. This function should count the number of Xs and the number of Os in the string.
# It should then return a boolean value of either True or False.
# If the count of Xs and Os are equal, then the function should return True. If the count isn't the same, it should return False.
# If there are no Xs or Os in the string, it should also return True because 0 equals 0. The string can contain any type and number of characters.
